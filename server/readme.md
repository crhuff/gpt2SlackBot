# Readme

## Install

Install python3 and pip3

	pip3 install tensorflow==1.15
	pip3 install gpt-2-simple
	pip3 install flask

You might need to `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`

You might also need to install the latest setuptools for tensorflow (if it throws a warning during install)

	pip3 install setuptools

## Files

Make sure you have a folder in the root of this project called `checkpoint` with the models inside.

Extracting the `checkpoint_run1.tar` file should create this checkpoint folder.

Note: currently we are only using the run named `run1`.

## Run

	python3 serer.py

Hit the server with a GET request at `localhost:5000/message` and it should respond with generated text. 

Note: it takes ~10-15 seconds to generate the text and respond as it has to create the session and load the model on each call (need to find a way to create/load before the call and just generate on api call)

I am not training the model locally
